## Data Structure Concepts

### 📅 Day 1 - Linked List

(Date: 02-Jan-2026)

- ⁠Learned the introduction and importance of data structures in organizing and managing data efficiently.
- ⁠Studied key features of data structures in Java such as efficiency, reusability, and optimization.
- Understood different types of data structures in Java including linear and non-linear structures.
- ⁠Learned the concept and working of single linked lists.
- ⁠Studied doubly linked lists and how they allow traversal in both directions.
- ⁠Understood circular linked lists and their advantages over linear linked lists.

### 📅 Day 2 - Stack, Queue, HashMap and Hashing Functions

(Date: 03-Jan-2026)

- Learned the concept of stack and its working based on the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
- ⁠Studied queue and its working based on the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
- ⁠Practiced basic stack and queue operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- ⁠Learned the concept of hashing and how a hashing function works.
- ⁠Studied HashMap in Java and how it stores data using key–value pairs for fast access.

### 📅 Day 3 - Sorting Algorithms

(Date: 04-Jan-2026)

- Learned and implemented fundamental sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Counting Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- Understood time and space complexity trade-offs of each sorting technique and their best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios.
- Practiced applying sorting algorithms to real-world style problems such as ordering student marks and structured datasets.
