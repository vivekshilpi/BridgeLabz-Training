# BridgeLabz-Training

### 📅 Day 1 – Java Generics (Fundamentals & Scenarios)
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**

- Learned Generics basics: type safety, reusability, compile-time checks, and removal of type casting.
- Practiced generic classes, methods, bounded types, and wildcards.
- Implemented real-world scenarios:
   - `Smart Warehouse` – Generic storage with bounded types.
   - `Online Marketplace` – Generic products and discount methods.
   - `University Course System` – Managed multiple course types using wildcards.
   - `Meal Plan Generator` – Validated meal categories with bounded generics.
   - `AI Resume Screening` – Processed resumes for multiple job roles safely.

### Day 3 - Java Streams

*(Date: 19-Jan-2026)*

- Learned Java I/O Streams and how they are used to perform input and output operations in Java.
- Studied different types of streams in Java based on data handling and functionality.
- Learned File Streams to read and write data directly from files.
- Studied Object Streams to read and write Java objects using serialization and deserialization.
- Learned ByteArray Streams to handle data in memory using byte arrays.
- Studied Buffered Streams to improve I/O performance by reducing direct disk access.
- Learned Reader and Writer classes to handle character-based input and output operations.
- Understood key considerations such as stream closing, exception handling, and performance impact.
- Learned best practices for Java I/O by using buffering, try-with-resources, and choosing the right stream type.

### Day 4 - Exception Handling

*(Date: 20-Jan-2026)*

- Learned exceptions in Java and how they handle runtime errors to prevent abnormal program termination.
- Studied different types of exceptions in Java including checked and unchecked exceptions.
- Learned custom exceptions to handle application-specific error conditions.
- Studied exception handling using try-catch, finally blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- Studied try-with-resources statement to automatically close resources after use.
- Learned the throws clause to declare exceptions that may be passed to the calling method.
- Studied the throw statement to explicitly throw an exception.
- Learned defining constructors in custom exception classes to pass error messages or causes.

- Practiced common `Regex patterns` for email, password, and phone number validation.
- Learned Java `Regex API` using Pattern and Matcher classes.
- Studied `Regex methods` find(), matches(), and replaceAll().
- Learned the basics of the `JUnit` framework for unit testing.
- Studied JUnit `annotations`, `test class structure`, and `assertions`.
