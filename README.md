## Week 6 : Java 8 Features

### Day 1 - Lambda Expressions & Method Reference

*(Date: 27-Jan-2026)*

- Explored `lambda expressions` to understand functional programming concepts and concise implementation of functional interfaces in Java.
- Practiced different lambda expression syntaxes and learned how they reduce boilerplate code and improve readability.
- Understood `method references` as a cleaner alternative to lambda expressions by directly referring to existing methods.
- Studied different types of method references including static methods, instance methods, and constructor references.
- - Implemented custom and predefined functional interfaces (`Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`).
- Practiced method references:
  - Static, instance, and constructor forms.

### Day 2 – Streams & Collectors  
**(Date: 28-Jan-2026)**
- Studied Java Stream API fundamentals and lazy evaluation.
- Practiced stream creation from collections, arrays, and generators.
- Used intermediate operations:
  - `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`, `sorted`, `distinct`, `limit`.
- Applied terminal operations:
  - `collect`, `forEach`, `reduce`, `count`, `findFirst`.
- Learned Collectors usage:
  - `toList`, `toSet`, `joining`
  - `groupingBy`, `partitioningBy`, `summarizingInt`.
- Practiced parallel streams and performance considerations.
- Implemented a mini project and Java 8 workshop using Streams and Collectors:
  - Appointment filtering, grouping, counting, and sorting.
- Solved practice problems and committed all work.
