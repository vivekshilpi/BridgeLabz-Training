- Quick Sort: Partitions the array around a pivot and recursively sorts the subarrays for efficient average performance.
- Counting Sort: Sorts elements by counting occurrences of each value, making it efficient for a known, limited range of integers.
- Selection Sort: Repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and places it at the correct position.
- Heap Sort: Uses a heap data structure to repeatedly extract the maximum or minimum element to produce a sorted array.
