## Week 8 : MySQL & JDBC Practice

### Day 1 : DBMS & MySQL
*(Date: 07-Feb-2026)*

- Explored the fundamentals of `DBMS` and how it enables efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data.
- Understood core `DBMS concepts` such as `tables`, `keys`, `relationships`, and `constraints`.
- Analyzed `normalization techniques` and their role in reducing `data redundancy` and improving `data integrity`.
- Practiced writing `SQL queries` including `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `WHERE` clauses.
- Implemented `MySQL` as a `relational database management system` to apply DBMS concepts practically.
- Worked with `joins` and `aggregate functions` in MySQL to retrieve and analyze data efficiently.

### JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
*(Date: 09-Feb-2026)*

- Explored `JDBC` and its role in connecting Java applications with relational databases.
- Understood the architecture of JDBC including `JDBC API`, `JDBC Driver`, and `Database`.
- Studied different types of `JDBC Drivers` such as Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4 drivers.
- Learned the steps to establish a database connection using `DriverManager`, `Connection`, `Statement`, and `ResultSet`.
- Practiced executing `SQL queries` using `Statement` and `PreparedStatement`.
- Analyzed the benefits of `PreparedStatement` for preventing `SQL Injection` and improving performance.
- Worked with `ResultSet` to retrieve and process data from the database.
- Implemented `CRUD operations` (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using JDBC.
- Managed transactions using `commit()` and `rollback()` for data consistency.
- Applied best practices such as proper `exception handling` and closing resources using `try-with-resources`.
